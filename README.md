# Synacor Challenge

The code in this repository is my solution for the [Synacor challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/).

Much like my [Advent of Code](https://github.com/rvaughan/AdventOfCode2017) solutions
the code in this repository may induce nausea, bleeding from the eyes, etc.

##Â Running

```bash
    # python challenge_test.py
    # python challenge_bootstrap.py
```

## Codes Collected

  * 'IfulsTiNMnCF' is found in the architecture spec document.
  * 'LeMMfJlsaONr' is the first code printed out by the virtual machine when running instruction 0.
  * 'fpjUOYRvdaom' is the code seen once you successfully have implemented the VM code and can boot it successfully.
